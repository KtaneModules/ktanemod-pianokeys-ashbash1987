  Title: Piano Keys Module
  Description: "[b][i]What do you get when you drop a piano down a mine shaft? A flat
    minor.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1]About[/h1]\r\nThie module employs the use of a standard
    12-tone piano keyboard and identification of symbols from common western music
    notation as its main gimmick.\r\n\n[h1]Cruel Variant[/h1]\nThis module now comes
    with a cruel variant! By default, you'll never get a cruel version of the module,
    so that the behavior remains the same as before. However, if you feel you want
    an added challenge, you can change the likelihood that a piano keys module will
    become cruel by editing the mod settings.\nTo find the settings, go to your steam
    directory, then go to [i]steamapps/workshop/content/341800/720356976[/i] and inside
    there, there should be a [i]modSettings.json[/b] configuration file. Open that
    up in notepad, and change the \"CruelProbability\" value from 0.0 to a value of
    your choosing from 0.0 to 1.0. 0.0 will mean that you'll never get the cruel variant,
    and 1.0 will mean that you'll always get the cruel variant. 0.5 would offer up
    the cruel variant roughly 50% of the time.\n\r\n[h1]Manual Page[/h1]\r\nThe manual
    PDFs are included in the download. However, you can also go to the following links
    to view the manuals:\n[url=https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-pianokeys/Manual/]Normal
    Piano Keys[/url]\r\n\r[url=https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-pianokeys/CruelManual/]Cruel
    Piano Keys[/url]\r\n\r\n[h1]Mission Makers[/h1]\r\nFor those making custom missions
    and wanting to reference this module, the type name is [b][i]PianoKeys[/i][/b]."
